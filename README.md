Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.
Return a list of pairs in ascending order (with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows
===
a, b are from arr
a < b
b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr

Test case 01

input arr: [4,2,3,1]

output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

Explanation: the minimum absolute difference is 1, List all pair with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.

---
 Test case 02

input arr: [1,3,6,10,15]

output: [[1,3]]

Explanation: the minimum absolute difference is 2, List all pair with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
